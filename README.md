# Coding Interview Roadmap – Solutions

A collection of my solutions while following the **Coding Interview Roadmap by DesignGurus.io**.

## Overview

This repository contains my implementations, notes, and explanations for algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving patterns covered in the roadmap.
It aligns with the course’s focus on mastering core concepts through a combination of theory and hands-on coding challenges.

## Purpose

- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Understand and apply common coding patterns
- Prepare efficiently for technical interviews
- Track personal progress through organized, topic-based solutions

## Notes

This is an ongoing learning project. Solutions may be revised over time as I improve or discover better approaches.
